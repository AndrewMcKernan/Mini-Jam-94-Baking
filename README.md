# Mini-Jam-94-Baking
A jam themed around baking. The restriction is that you can only use two buttons. 

The idea is to create a strategy game, inspired by Fire Emblem and Star Wars Miniatures. The mouse cursor can be moved, and the two buttons will be the left and right mouse buttons. 

There will be a weapon triangle/RPS style system with unit types. The soldiers are baked goods for a cake. 

The objective is to get your soldiers into the correct locations, so the ingredients are distributed and the cake can be made.

Opposing you will be kitchen goop, flies, mold, and other kitchen nightmares. 

Let's see how far we get!
